;;; Commentary:

;; Much of this code was revamped by Hrvoje Niksic, July 1997, with
;; version number set to 2.x.

;; Pending-del is now a minor mode, with all the normal toggle
;; functions.  It should be somewhat faster, too.

you can customize the default value from the options menu (auto delete
selection)."
